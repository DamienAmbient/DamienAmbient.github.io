# Personal training web-site by Dmytro Klepko

# The main idea is to create a spare car parts online shop.

# So, here are the feature-list of this web-site:

# - sticky nav;

# - smooth-scroll to different sections;

# - products are loading from json;

# - produts in the basket are also placed in localStorage;

# - form (currently with no submit option);

# - table inside basket (thought it's not visible and apparently not needed by design but recommended to finish the current project)

# - an ability to add product to the basket;

# - an ability to edit products in basket: increase and decrease amount or delete item or the whole list;

# - an ability to close basket by button, by esc keyboard or by click on empty space;

# - some basic css hover effects;

# - very simple adaptation for mobile devices;

# There could be some more features like: search panel, carousel, ability to register users...and many more, but I prefer to make it with MERN-stack which is obviously not the topic of this project.
